# Changelog

All notable changes to Tack are documented here. The format follows
`## [x.y.z]` version headers so `/changelog` and the startup "what's new"
notice can parse entries (same convention as TS pi).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-26

First stable release. Tack is a Rust reimplementation of the TypeScript pi
coding agent — wire- and storage-compatible, with the same session files
(transparent v1–v4 migration), RPC/ACP wire protocols, provider registry and
model catalog, and CLI flags.

### Highlights

- Interactive TUI, headless print mode, ACP editor integration (Zed,
  JetBrains, …), JSONL RPC mode.
- Remote sessions: `tack serve` over TCP/WebSocket/TLS with token auth;
  attach from `tack client` or the embedded browser client.
- 42 built-in providers (40 mirroring TS pi, plus zero-config local ollama
  and llama.cpp) with the full 1130-model catalog embedded.
- Background tasks, LSP navigation & diagnostics, file checkpoints,
  persistent memory, sub-agents with worktree isolation, cross-session
  search, cron, OS sandbox, declarative permissions, MCP client and server,
  eval framework.
- Extensible via subprocess plugins (NDJSON/JSON-RPC) or sandboxed WASM,
  plus Claude-Code-compatible lifecycle hooks.
- `tack update` self-update from `tack-v*` GitHub releases; private by
  default (no telemetry).
